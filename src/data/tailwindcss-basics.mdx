# Getting Started with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS has quickly become one of the most popular utility-first CSS frameworks. Instead of writing traditional CSS, you use **utility classes** directly in your HTML or JSX to style components. This makes building modern, responsive, and consistent interfaces faster and more maintainable.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind is a **utility-first CSS framework**. That means instead of creating custom CSS rules for every component, you compose styles using pre-defined classes like:

- `flex`, `grid`, `block`
- `text-lg`, `font-bold`, `text-center`
- `p-4`, `m-2`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow`

This approach removes the need to constantly switch between HTML/JSX and CSS files.

## Installing Tailwind CSS

You can set up Tailwind with almost any project. If you’re using **Next.js**, here’s a quick setup:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
